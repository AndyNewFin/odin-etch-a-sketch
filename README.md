# odin-etch-a-sketch
4/16/2022 Started this project by writing out the instructions with some pseudocode for each step

Worked on the project for 2-3 hours a day, trying to complete each of the steps
-One issue I am learning about JS code is sometimes the entire JS has to be complete and correct in contrast to completing one step then trying another step
-The Odin Project states "plenty of resources on the net for learning stuff that we havenâ€™t covered yet" and to use Google for help... 
	-but since the coding language is so vast and I'm still learning, I do not know exactly what to Google
		- I did get a lot of help from Discord and Stack Overflow
		
Postitive: I am happy thar I was able to write out alot of the code before seeking help
- I estimate I completed these percents before reaching outside help
	-HTML 100%
	-CC    80%
	-JS    50%

I am about 98% complete with this project! One of the issue that remains is when I click "New Grid"... some odd numbers like 7 or 9, the new grid will not align correctly
	-I am still having perfecting my flexbox code! I created more containers then I needed too 1) Main container   2) Grid container      3) Button container
